# Mini Arcade Games
*Mini Arcade Games was done as part of the Computational Thinking module at Singapore University of Design and Technology (SUTD)*

### Description   
This game is aimed at stressed SUTD students. The goal was to allow students to distress through a series of mini-games created using our newfound knowledge of Python to 
create a better world by design. We plan to have these games displayed in the area above the Indoor Sports Hall where the food vending machines are. 
Allowing students to relax when they crave some food after burning the midnight oil.  

This arcade machine would contain 4 different mini-games. Snake, Space Shooter, Lumberjack and Air Hockey. 
When the Python file is run, the user can choose one out of these 4 games to be played.
